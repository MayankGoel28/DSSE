# Domain-Specific Search Engine
**DSSE**, pronounced *dɐs'ɪ*, is a comprehensive implementation of the entire stack required for Search Engines. DSSE uses Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency to predict cluster levels, and works on the concept of a knowledge base, creating an ontology for the domain-specific data that exists. DSSE is implemented on all layers, from a web crawler, to indexing (including a refinement using the above mentioned clustering algorithm) and a web application with a chatbot interface for queries.<br>
The domain for this Implementation is Walmart, a hugely popular e-commerce website.
